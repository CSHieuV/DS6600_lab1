# DS6600_lab1

For this project, I decided to use the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). This license permits anyone to modify and distribute my code without restriction, as well as use it for commercial, educational, or personal purposes. The crucial element is that my code must remain under the same license if it is altered and shared. This stops others from stealing my work, deleting the freedom I meant for the community, and locking it down with a more restricted license.

If I didn't include a license, the default under copyright law would have been “all rights reserved.” This implies that others couldn't lawfully replicate, modify, or distribute my code. The GPLv3 clearly indicates that my code is available for free use, but only if it remains open for all.

This is the relevant section that includes the .env
